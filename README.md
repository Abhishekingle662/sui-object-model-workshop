# Sui Object Model Workshop

When learning Sui Move, developers are encouraged to use best practices to utilize the Sui object model and ensure on-chain object composability. Developers learn to write composable move code in a timely manner, but struggle to verify their code by deploying and executing the functionality on chain. The key to mastering the Sui object model is to pair your Sui move development sessions with interacting with on-chain objects via PTBs (Programmable Transaction Blocks). This workshop will guide you through the process of writing Sui Move code, deploying it to the Sui blockchain, and interacting with on-chain objects via PTBs.
